# Time-Series
Public clone of previous private project on time series.

The main goal of this project is to establish appropriate univariable and multivariable time series models to forecast future temperature levels based on the analysis of characteristics in the past observations. In specific, this report analyses the past 20 year daily and weekly meteorological data in Atlanta, from 2002 to 2022, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed and air pressure time series. ARIMA(X), SARIMA(X) and VAR(X) models are utilized for describing the features in time series and predict future 28 days or 28 weeks temperatures, depending on data aggregation used.
